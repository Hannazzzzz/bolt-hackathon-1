# [Name tbd] Restaurant Calorie Estimator

AI-powered conversational tool for estimating calories at restaurants, especially independent and ethnic establishments.

## The Problem
- 62% of users complain about missing local restaurants in calorie apps
- 35-50% estimation errors for independent/ethnic restaurants
- Current apps create food obsession (71% develop disordered eating patterns)

## Our Solution
Conversational calorie estimation focused on restaurants with mindful logging approach.

## Tech Stack
- Bolt.new + React/Next.js
- Claude Sonnet 4 for conversational parsing
- USDA FoodData Central API

## Daily Progress
- **Day 1: Market research and strategic positioning** - Dove deep into the calorie tracking market and discovered the restaurant estimation gap is huge (see research files in repo). Found that 62% of users complain about missing local restaurants while existing apps focus on packaged foods and chains. Tested USDA FoodData Central API - 1,000 free requests/hour should be plenty for MVP testing. Also set up project voice guidelines and hackathon strategy docs to keep the 25-day timeline realistic. Main insight: positioning as "restaurant calorie estimator" rather than "another MyFitnessPal clone" gives us actual differentiation in a crowded market.
